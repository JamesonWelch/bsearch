# bsearch
Command Line Interface that opens up a new browser tab and Google searches the argument

This project is Open-source, and all feedback and conrtibtions are welcomed. 

Quotes are needed for the entire query:

    $ bsearch 'all the things to search for'
    
Install Instructions:

1) After downloading the file, navigate to where the downloaded file is located and change the modifications:

    `$ chmod +x bsearch`
    
2) Then move the file to a $PATH folder:

    `$ mv bsearch /usr/local/bin`
    
 
Packaging is still being worked on and will be coming soon to make installation easier.
I hope bsearch helps your workflow!
